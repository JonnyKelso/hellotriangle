# helloTriangle
A learning exercise exploring some OpenGL concepts.
This project is based on the LearnOpenGL tutorial from https://learnopengl.com/ but using modern C++

Uses:
 * glad https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad and glfw https://www.glfw.org/download.html to configure an OpenGL context, spawn a window and rendering onto it, 
 * glm https://github.com/g-truc/glm for  shader maths utils, 
 * stb_image_loader https://github.com/nothings/stb to load textures, 
 * Open Asset Import Library (assimp) http://assimp.org/ for loading model files.
